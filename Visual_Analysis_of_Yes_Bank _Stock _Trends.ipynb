The main goal was to understand how the stock behaved over time and to gather insights that can help the bank make better decisions and build stronger investor confidence.\n","\n","We used a dataset containing monthly stock prices, including Open, High, Low, and Close values. With this data, we created 15 different visualizations, each showing a different aspect of the stock’s performance.\n","\n","The first few charts helped us understand how the closing price changed over the years. We noticed that the stock price remained mostly under ₹100 for a long time, with only a few months crossing higher values. This showed us that the stock hasn’t seen consistent high growth, which could reflect investor uncertainty or past business challenges.\n","\n","Other charts like Open vs Close, High vs Low, and price range plots helped us see how stable or unstable the stock was in certain periods. We also added a moving average chart, which made it easier to smooth out short-term ups and downs and look at the bigger picture.\n","\n","We also explored year-wise trends using bar charts and boxplots. This gave us a clear view of which years were more volatile and which were stable. We found that in some years, the price had large ups and downs, while other years were relatively calm. Understanding this can help the bank identify what happened during the tough times and how to prevent similar situations.\n","\n","One of the more interesting charts was the monthly price change chart, which showed whether the stock closed higher or lower than it opened. This simple plot gave a quick snapshot of investor sentiment — whether people were generally buying or selling during the month.\n","\n","We ended the analysis with a pair plot that showed the relationships between Open, High, Low, and Close prices. The plot confirmed that these values usually move together, which is expected in a stable and well-performing stock.\n","\n","All the insights gathered from these charts can be very helpful to Yes Bank. For example, knowing that prices have remained low for a long time tells the bank that it may need to focus on rebuilding investor trust. This can be done through improved performance, better communication, and transparency.\n","\n","The bank can also use these insights to plan ahead. For instance, by looking at past patterns, they can prepare better for market ups and downs. In future work, machine learning models could even be added to predict future stock prices based on this data.\n","\n","Overall, this project showed how much value simple data and visualizations can bring. Even without complex algorithms, we were able to understand trends, spot risks, and suggest improvements. These kinds of insights help businesses like Yes Bank make smarter decisions based on data — not guesses."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Yes Bank’s stock has gone through a lot of ups and downs over the years.
